# SUMMARY

### Breast Cancer Dataset is used in this.
### 1. We have used three models: Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, SVC on breast cancer dataset.
### 2. Logistic Regression
Accuracy: 99.12%
Precision: 98.61%
Recall: 100%
F1-score: 99.30%
High precision and recall balance, making it a reliable and consistent model.
### 3. SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
Accuracy: 98.25%
Precision: 97.26%
Recall: 100%
F1-score: 98.61%
Perfect recall indicates zero false negatives.
### 4. Random Forest Classifier
Accuracy: 96.49%
Precision: 95.89%
Recall: 98.59%
F1-score: 97.22%
### 5. In terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score Logistic Regression is the best performing model.
### 6. In terms of recall SVC is best as it has 100% recall and also it has 98.25% accuracy.
### 7. Random Forest Classifier is the least performing model.
