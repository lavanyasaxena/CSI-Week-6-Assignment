# SUMMARY

### 1. We have used three models: **Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, SVC** on *breast cancer* dataset.
### 2. **Logistic Regression**
* **Accuracy:** 96.49%
* **Precision:** 95.89%
* **Recall:** 98.59%
* **F1-score:** 97.22%
* High precision and recall balance, making it a reliable and consistent model.
### 3. **SVC (Support Vector Classifier)**
* **Accuracy:** 94.74%
* **Precision:** 92.21%
* **Recall:** 100%
* **F1-score:** 95.95%
* Perfect recall indicates *zero false negatives*, which is excellent for use cases where missing a positive case is costly (e.g., medical diagnosis).
* Slightly lower precision compared to others, suggesting more false positives.
### 4. **Random Forest Classifier**
* **Accuracy:** 96.49%
* **Precision:** 95.89%
* **Recall:** 98.59%
* **F1-score:** 97.22%
* Performs identically to Logistic Regression, showing high accuracy and a great balance of all metrics. Also benefits from model interpretability and feature importance.
### 5. In terms of *accuracy* Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier have 96.49%.
### 6. In terms of *recall* SVC is best as it has 100% recall.
